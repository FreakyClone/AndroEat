# AndroEat
AndroEat is an android application that was created with the use of Android Studio.

My application is a helpful app that allows you to order food from a single restaurant using phone instead of using a laptop or desktop.

This is my first app I created which I done a lot of research and took too much time to make it but am proud of demonstrating this kind of a significant level of complexity.

In this app, Firebase were used for the databases and Paypal sandbox for payments. Additionally, google services were used as well.



Features that were used for the application:
